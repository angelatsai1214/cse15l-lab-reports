## About Me! 
I am a first year student studying ""Math and Computer Science** at *UC San Diego*! My home town is Los Angeles. I recently got a pin and I would like to share the quote on it:
> “The only person you should compare yourself to is the person that you were yesterday.”

\ I really like this quote because it reminds me that I shouldn't be intimidated the fact that I am entering a very competitive field and there are many good CS people out there, rather I should only compare with myself and be proud of my progress along the way!
